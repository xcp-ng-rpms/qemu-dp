* `master` contains sources for the next `x.y` release of XCP-ng.
* `x.y` (e.g. `7.5`) contains sources for the `x.y` release of XCP-ng, with their bugfix and/or security updates.
* `XS-x.y` (e.g. `XS-7.5`), when they exist, contain sources from the `x.y` release of XenServer, with trademarked or copyrighted material stripped if needed.
